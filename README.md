Non-Lethal Falls!
======

Because falling shouldn't always be to your death.


## How to use it?

The mod, just by being present on the server (or just being installed on your end for Singleplayer), lets you live fall damage with 1 HP (half a heart),
and does the same for tamable entities like wolves, camels, horses, etc. to also prevent annoying accidental pet deaths.

You can use [McQoy](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcqoy) to edit its config values from ModMenu for Singleplayer use. Otherwise, config values are read every game/server restart from the `config` folder's file for the mod, and are not world-specific. Config values include 
whether to enable/disable the mod entirely, whether to make players and/or tamable entities immune, and how much health to live with.

That's all there is to it!
